# L.E.A.G.U.E.

Laker Educationally Accessible Game Understanding Engine is an engine built on top of PyGame to teach basic game development aspects.

Note that this was designed with education in mind.  Therefore optimization is not of the essence.  We will not (for instance) use concepts like DirtySprites or updating only parts of the screen, relying instead upon a more traditional (easier to understand albeit less optimal) approach.

# Classes

**Engine** - the core game engine.  No game logic should go here, merely the game loop.

**Graphics** - a utility class for graphics functions.

**Settings** - a static class used to hold default values needed by the Engine class.
